/***** Ray Tracer *****/

This is a Ray Tracer Framework made by Cedric Portaneri from December 2015 to January 2016 in C++. This school project was made for the Computer Graphics course in the M2R Interaction taught by Tobias Isenberg who gave me the baseline of the framework. 

I implemented features such as: 
- Raycasting with spheres, planes, boxes, triangles, quads and cylinder
- Illumination model (Phong and Gooch)
- Normal buffer & z-buffer
- Optical laws (Reflection and Refraction)
- Anti-aliasing (SuperSampling with grid, jitter or random pattern)
- Extended Camera Model (Zoom, Image size, Camera and Center positions)
- Texture mapping
- 3D mesh files (.obj)
